Biography:
I'm now a Wendy and Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral reseach fellow at Uchicago under professor Junhong chen's
guidance with his supporting resource from argonne national lab. I got my bachelor degree in Nanjing University in China,
and also p.h.D from Nanjing University with experience as visiting exchange student in the Hong Kong university of science
and technology. During my doctorâ€™s period, my research projects mainly focus on exploring the cross-cutting field of
machine learning with renewable energy material design and theoretical simulation (First principal simulation and quantum
chemistry). I am familiar with machine learning and have done a series of works that applied artificial intelligence to boost
the design of membrane electrode assembly in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and other works that utilize
ML to investigate the system of PEM electrolyzers and CO2RR electrocatalysts for the purpose of renewable energy. Now I
am working on the NSF-funded project MADE-PUBLIC (Manufacturing ADvanced Electronics throughPrintingUsing Biobased
and Locally Identifiable Compounds) to investigate how machine learning could help with the research spanning
different scientific fields.
Current Research:
The electronic and lithium-ion battery (LIB) sectors are pivotal for modern society, yet they pose significant environmental
challenges due to carbon emissions and non-recyclable waste. Presently, the centralized synthesis and assembly of most
electronic devices and batteries make them susceptible to supply chain disruptions, leading to cost and efficiency
fluctuations. A promising alternative is transitioning from silicon-based materials to renewable bio-mass derived from plants.
Utilizing natural components like lignin and cellulose, we can produce nano-sized graphene and cellulose inks. With
advanced 3D inkjet printing, we can fabricate diverse electronic devices, from field effect transistors (FET) to LIBs and
sensors, in a decentralized manner, significantly reducing carbon footprints.
Drawing from my prior experience in applying machine learning for the efficient prediction and design of electrocatalysts,
devices, and components in fuel cells and water electrolyzers, I've recognized the immense potential of integrating
experimental data, data science, and theoretical simulation like Density Functional Theory (DFT) for optimal results. This
holistic approach has not only enhanced the performance and efficiency of these systems but has also paved the way for
innovative solutions in the electronic sector.
These high-value products can also integrate seamlessly into previous stages; for instance, sensors can optimize plant
growth conditions, enhancing their utility as material resources. This green approach could redefine the future of
electronics. The evolution of this pathway can be accelerated by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). By
training ML models on data from each loop stage, we can offer precise experimental guidance. The ultimate goal is to
establish an open-source, AI/ML-powered platform, the Biodegradable Electronic Manufacturing Data Infrastructure
(BEMDI), to democratize the production of eco-friendly, customizable electronic devices. Additionally, the data generated
will be integrated into existing material databases and manufacturing platform, facilitating knowledge transfer for future
endeavors. Besides, I am also interested and experienced in leveraging large language models for scientific data mining.
And another research directory of mine is automation experimental systems in laboratory driven by AI backend that would
allow autonomous materials and device discovery.
