## Progress on Our BRAINIAC Initiative 🧠

Just submitted our NSF ACCESS allocation progress report, and I wanted to share some highlights! The BRAINIAC project (Broad‐scope Reasoning Artificial Intelligence for Nano-micro Identification, Assessment, and Categorization) is really taking off! 🌟

### What we've accomplished 📊

- Our proof-of-concept is now **published as a cover article** in Molecular Systems Design & Engineering! 🎉
- Our SGNN model achieved **89% classification accuracy** on sensor data - that's 4x better than random baselines!
- We've successfully extracted and structured data from over 1,400 research papers using LLM-assisted text mining

### How BRAINIAC (in the MSDE paper is the meta version) works ⚙️

BRAINIAC combines three powerful approaches:
1. **LLM-Assisted Text Mining** to convert research papers into structured datasets 📚
2. **Spiking Graph Neural Networks** that fuse global properties with molecular details 🔄
3. **High-Fidelity Simulations** (DFT/AIMD) for mechanistic validation 🔬

The coolest part? We're bridging the gap between isolated ML approaches and how human experts actually think and reason about materials!


### Challenges & next steps 🔮

Scaling up isn't easy! We're working on:
- Processing hundreds of thousands more publications, More! and More! We want to scale it up to 1 Million+ Publications!
- Including time-series sensor response data
- Running more simulations across diverse material families
- Building an API so others can use BRAINIAC for their research
