Submitted our NSF ACCESS progress report for the BRAINIAC project. Summary of current status:

**Completed:**
- Published proof-of-concept as MSDE cover article
- Extracted structured data from 1,400+ research papers via LLM-assisted mining
- Achieved 89% classification accuracy on sensor screening task

**In progress:**
- Scaling literature processing toward comprehensive coverage
- Incorporating time-series sensor response data
- Expanding DFT validation across material families
- Developing API for external research use

The core insight driving BRAINIAC: bridging isolated ML techniques into integrated workflows that mirror expert reasoning.
