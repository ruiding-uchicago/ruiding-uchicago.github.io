Received an NSF ACCESS allocation (1.5M credits) to support the BRAINIAC project. The computing resources will enable large-scale LLM processing of scientific literature and DFT simulations for materials screening.

Combined with support from Argonne's Center for Nanoscale Materials and the UChicago Data Science Institute AI+Science Research Initiative, this positions BRAINIAC for expanded scope in AI-driven materials discovery.
