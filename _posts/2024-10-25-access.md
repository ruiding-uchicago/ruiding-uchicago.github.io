## ðŸŽ‰ Exciting News! ðŸŽ‰

Iâ€™m **thrilled** to announce that our project, **BRAINIAC: An AI-Driven Framework for Accelerating Nano-Micro Materials Discovery and Device Innovation**, has received a substantial allocation from [NSF ACCESS](https://access-ci.org/) â€” **1.5 million credits**! This support will be instrumental in scaling up our efforts and pushing the boundaries of AI-driven materials discovery. 

BRAINIAC has already garnered major institutional support, with awards from **Argonne National Laboratoryâ€™s Nanoscale Materials** and the **2024 AI+Science Research Initiative** at **University of Chicagoâ€™s Data Science Institute**. These resources have enabled us to process **40,000+ publications** using LLMs and conduct thousands of **DFT simulations** for critical applications like detecting PFAS in water.

Special thanks to [Professor Junhong Chen](https://www.junhongchengroup.pme.uchicago.edu/junhongchen) and [Professor Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen.org/) for their ongoing support and guidance! Iâ€™m incredibly grateful for their mentorship, which makes all of this possible.

Weâ€™re also excited to share that our passionate PhD candidate, Rodrigo Pires Ferreira (rpferreira@uchicago.edu), is making **fantastic progress** on preliminary results for BRAINIAC. We plan to submit an initial manuscript by the end of **2024**! ðŸ“ˆ

With the ACCESS allocation, weâ€™re empowered to explore new possibilities in **AI and materials science**, contributing to **U.S. leadership in AI research** and paving the way for breakthrough discoveries.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue this exciting journey! ðŸš€
