## Big News: Our Research Published in Science Advances! 📣

I'm incredibly excited to announce that our latest work on multistage machine learning for catalyst discovery has been published in Science Advances! 🥂

### What's the breakthrough? ⚡

In this paper, we introduced a multistage machine learning framework that integrates three powerful techniques:
- Data mining 🔍
- Active learning 🔄
- Domain adaptation 🔀

This integrated approach helps us streamline the discovery of multimetallic catalysts - materials that are essential for clean energy technologies.

### How does it work? 🤔

Our framework leverages different data modalities through specialized ML modules. This allows us to objectively navigate an enormous candidate space of possible catalyst combinations.

The result? We identified a promising catalyst with excellent performance in wet-lab testing and real commercial potential! 💰

The whole paper is intuitive but relatively extensive in labor. So recommended to read the full text.
