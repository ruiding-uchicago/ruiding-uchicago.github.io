## Exciting News: Cover Article in Molecular Systems Design & Engineering! 🌟

I'm thrilled to share that our research on field-effect transistor chemical sensor design has been featured as the **cover article** in Molecular Systems Design & Engineering (Issue 5, 2025)! 🥳

### What's the research about? 🧪

Our team developed a unique spiking graph neural network (SGNN) architecture (brilliantly proposed by our PhD candidate Rodrigo Ferreira). This innovative approach effectively handles physicochemical cheminformatics by encoding information via two modalities (graph and spike) within field effect transistor chemical sensor knowledge graphs.

In simple terms: we created a smarter way to design chemical sensors using AI that thinks more like the human brain! 🧠

### Real-world impact 🌎

As a result, we significantly enhanced the virtual screening of optimal sensor probes for the challenging detection of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) - those troublesome "forever chemicals" that persist in our environment.

The paper has also been selected as part of MSDE's "Recent HOT Articles" collection! 🔥

Huge thanks to my amazing collaborators Rodrigo P. Ferreira, Fengxue Zhang, Haihui Pu, Claire Donnat, Yuxin Chen, and Junhong Chen! 👏

By the way this would be a very important milestone for me to realize the vision of BRAINIAC. Probably would submit some progress reports soon...
