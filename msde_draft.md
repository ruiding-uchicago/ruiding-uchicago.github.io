In our Molecular Systems Design & Engineering work—featured as the cover art for the upcoming issue—we developed a unique spiking graph neural network (SGNN) architecture (proposed by our PhD candidate Rodrigo Ferreira ). This innovative approach effectively handles physicochemical cheminformatics by encoding information via two modalities (graph and spike) within field effect transistor chemical sensor knowledge graphs. As a result, we significantly enhanced the virtual screening of optimal sensor probes for the challenging detection of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).
