<ul>
    <li class="mb-4">Proposed the <strong>'Broad-scope Reasoning Artificial Intelligence for Nano-micro material and devices Identification, Assessment, and Categorization' (BRAINIAC)</strong> Project, which focuses on enhancing materials discovery and device innovation using advanced data collection and machine learning in collaborative experimental frameworks.</li>
    <li class="mb-4">BRAINIAC aims to integrate a vast multi-fidelity dataset with sophisticated graph neural networks. BRAINIAC supports the identification and optimization of materials for various applications, typically including sensors and catalysts for renewable energy and environmental science. The project also fosters a collaborative scientific community, enabling continuous improvement and widespread adoption of AI-driven methodologies.</li>
    <li>Participate in the NSF-funded <strong>Manufacturing ADvanced Electronics through Printing Using Bio-based and Locally Identifiable Compounds (MADE-PUBLIC)</strong> Project as the Designer of the Data Portal to Facilitate Knowledge Transfer as well as a cyber-manufacturing platform.</li>
