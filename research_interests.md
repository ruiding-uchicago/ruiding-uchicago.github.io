<p>There are plenty of AI/ML in science applications today, especially for chemistry and material sciences. What are the challenges in methodology?</p>

        <h3 class="feature-title">Traditional Methods</h3>
        <p class="feature-description">In typical discovery, traditional trial-and-error methods are reliable but extremely time-consuming and expensive. While traditional methods often face significant theory-to-practice gaps, recent attempts using standard machine learning approaches still remain limited due to fragmented datasets and isolated methods.</p>

        <h3 class="feature-title">Standard ML</h3>
        <p class="feature-description">Standard machine learning, although promising, tends to operate in isolation, relying on single-stage modeling and limited or fragmented data. This narrow scope makes it difficult to fully leverage available information, hindering comprehensive understanding and robust predictions.</p>

    <div class="feature-card">
        <h3 class="feature-title">Nature of Scientific Research</h3>
        <p class="feature-description">Recognizing these challenges, our work generally aligns machine learning closely with the iterative, exploratory, and inherently multi-modal nature of real scientific research.</p>

<p>We want to develop fully integrated, multi-stage machine learning pipelines, specifically designed to bridge the gap between theory, computation, and experiments. Our approaches aim to leverage diverse datasets, iterative refinement, and structured data comprehension&mdash;addressing previous limitations directly.</p>

<p>Moreover, we also would like to attempt to make improvements in representation of domain knowledge. Most existing work still uses typical simplified manual encoding in the ML modeling process.</p>

<p>Our interest is also how to use LLM to process knowledge graphs, and potentially agents to automate the process to enable truly meaningful inverse design ability.</p>
