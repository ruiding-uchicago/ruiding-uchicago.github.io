    <p>My name is Rui Ding and I go by "Ray" for my first name for exactly the same pronunciation.</p>
    <p>I'm now a Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Chicago under professor Junhong Chen's guidance with his supporting resources from Argonne National Lab. I got my bachelor's degree in Nanjing University in China, and also Ph.D. from Nanjing University with experience as a visiting exchange student in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p>
    <p>During my doctoral period, my research projects mainly focus on exploring the cross-cutting field of machine learning with renewable energy material design and theoretical simulation (First principal simulation and quantum chemistry). I am familiar with machine learning and have done a series of works that applied artificial intelligence to boost the design of membrane electrode assembly in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and other works that utilize ML to investigate the system of PEM electrolyzers and CO2RR electrocatalysts for the purpose of renewable energy.</p>
    <p>Now I am working on the NSF-funded project MADE-PUBLIC (Manufacturing ADvanced Electronics through Printing Using Biobased and Locally Identifiable Compounds) to investigate how machine learning could help with research spanning different scientific fields.</p>
    <p>Researchers interested in collaborating are warmly welcomed to get in touch with me. Professors Junhong and Yuxin are also highly open to collaborative discussions and partnerships.</p>
