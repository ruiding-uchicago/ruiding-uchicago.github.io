        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Since September 2023, I've been serving as an Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago under <a href="https://www.junhongchengroup.pme.uchicago.edu/junhongchen" target="_blank">Professor Junhong Chen</a>'s guidance, with a joint appointment as a Resident Associate at Argonne National Laboratory.</p>

    <p>I'm also co-advised by <a href="https://yuxinchen.org/" target="_blank">Professor Yuxin Chen</a> at the Computer Science Department at University of Chicago. We collaborate on the interactive learning side on bandit problems regarding chemistry/materials science fields, LLM applications, and more.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Current Research: BRAINIAC</h2>
    </div>

    <p>My current research focuses on the development of <strong>BRAINIAC</strong> (Broad-scope Reasoning Artificial Intelligence for Nano-micro material and devices Identification, Assessment, and Categorization), an ambitious project at the intersection of artificial intelligence and materials science.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Our recent breakthroughs have been published in prestigious journals including <em>Science Advances</em> and <em>Molecular Systems Design & Engineering</em>.</p>

    <p>The BRAINIAC framework serves as a transformative approach to chemistry/materials informatics. Our ambition is to process large quantities of domain knowledge, creating a unified intelligent universal purpose framework that revolutionizes how we discover and optimize new chemicals/materials.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Additional Research Interests</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Personally, I am very interested in the post-training of LLMs, especially active in-context learning. I am exploring both intrinsic self-correction and extrinsic fair-asymmetric approaches.</p>

    <p>I'm also contributing to the NSF-funded <strong>MADE-PUBLIC</strong> project (Manufacturing ADvanced Electronics through Printing Using Biobased and Locally Identifiable Compounds), developing advanced cyber-manufacturing platforms and data portals for knowledge transfer.</p>

    <p>I also collaborate with numerous experimentalists for standard traditional chemistry and materials science research, including explanatory dry lab simulation and data analysis work.</p>

    <div class="card mt-8">
        <h3 class="font-semibold mb-4">Interested in Collaboration?</h3>
        <p class="text-muted mb-0">Researchers interested in collaborations at the intersection of AI, data science, and materials research are warmly welcomed to get in touch. Professors Junhong Chen and Yuxin Chen are also highly open to collaborative discussions and partnerships.</p>
