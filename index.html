<p>I'm now a Wendy and Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral reseach fellow at Uchicago under professor Junhong chen's
guidance with his supporting resource from argonne national lab. I got my bachelor degree in Nanjing University in China,
and also p.h.D from Nanjing University with experience as visiting exchange student in the Hong Kong university of science
and technology. During my doctor’s period, my research projects mainly focus on exploring the cross-cutting field of
machine learning with renewable energy material design and theoretical simulation (First principal simulation and quantum
chemistry). I am familiar with machine learning and have done a series of works that applied artificial intelligence to boost
the design of membrane electrode assembly in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and other works that utilize
ML to investigate the system of PEM electrolyzers and CO2RR electrocatalysts for the purpose of renewable energy. Now I
am working on the NSF-funded project MADE-PUBLIC (Manufacturing ADvanced Electronics throughPrintingUsing Biobased
and Locally Identifiable Compounds) to investigate how machine learning could help with the research spanning
different scientific fields.</p>
